# Hey there! ☄🏴🎮🎧
## ◼◾◽🔲🔘 Who am I? 🔘🔲◽◾◼
- I'm dark, a junior c++ programmer learning for game development. I have been learning since late January 2026 and have made various projects.
- I've developed skills in project documentation and planning over the years which I consider a key aspect of programming.
- I'm a 13 year old male Christian based in Kenya ✝👀

## 🎱♠🎮🌑Game Development. 🌑🎮♠🎱
- I personally specialise in gameplay programming and I'm still learning and applying my knowledge to become a master in my chosen field.
- I don't want to make games that people just see as "fun". I want to make games that encourage people to become Christians and give their life to Christ 

## 💻 What am I currently doing? 💻
- I'm learning C++ at an intermediate level and working to improve on my weak areas.
- Making a video game which is being documented on GitHub

#  ⁜ Cheers! ⁜
